For swipeable tabs, the app utilizes the Swiper JS package and its related API,
 as suggested, to render tabs on the UI.

A custom-tabs service was created for tabs to enhance reusability and code readability.

The TabsRenderingService is used to render HTML code for the renderBullet API.
I attempted to use ViewContainerRef.createComponent to instantiate the component (tabsheader),
but it seems that the renderBullet API does not support this.
It's something I am going to look into further.

Tab content was separated from custom tabs for reusability purposes by implementing parent-child data sharing.

An interface for tabs was created for readability and reusability purposes
